# Model Reloading Features

## Overview
This update adds intelligent handling for Watson ML model reloading scenarios, providing users with clear feedback when the model is starting up from cloud deployment.

## Features Added

### 1. Enhanced API Route (`/api/predict`)
- **Model Reloading Detection**: Automatically detects when Watson ML model is reloading based on:
  - HTTP status codes (503, 502)
  - Error message keywords ("loading", "starting", "initializing", etc.)
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time updates to frontend during prediction process
- **Progressive Retry Logic**: Longer wait times with exponential backoff for model reloading scenarios
- **Dual Mode Support**: Both streaming and non-streaming requests supported

### 2. Model Loading Indicator Component
- **Visual Progress**: Animated loading spinner with progress bar
- **Status Messages**: Real-time updates about model status
- **Educational Content**: Explains why model reloading happens
- **Responsive Design**: Works in both light and dark modes

### 3. Frontend Enhancements
- **Streaming Support**: Handles real-time updates from API
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Falls back to regular requests if streaming fails
- **State Management**: Tracks loading states and model reloading status
- **User Experience**: Clear messaging and progress indication

## How It Works

### Normal Prediction Flow
1. User uploads image
2. API processes image immediately
3. Results returned quickly
4. Standard loading indicator shown

### Model Reloading Flow
1. User uploads image
2. API detects model is reloading (503 error or specific messages)
3. Streaming response initiated
4. Real-time updates sent to frontend:
   - "Model is starting up from cloud deployment..."
   - "Model is still loading... Estimated wait time: 45s"
   - "Model is ready! Processing your image..."
5. Enhanced UI shows:
   - Progress bar with estimated completion
   - Educational message about why this happens
   - Reassurance that it's normal behavior

### Error Handling
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Up to 8 retry attempts for streaming requests
- Fallback to non-streaming if streaming fails
- Clear error messages for users

## Technical Implementation

### API Changes
```typescript
// New streaming endpoint
POST /api/predict
{
  "data": "base64_image_data",
  "stream": true  // Optional: enables streaming
}

// Streaming response format
data: {"status": "loading", "message": "Model is starting up..."}
data: {"status": "complete", "class": "Healthy", "confidence": 95.2}
data: [DONE]
```

### Frontend Changes
```typescript
// New state management
const [loadingMessage, setLoadingMessage] = useState<string>("Thinking...");
const [isModelReloading, setIsModelReloading] = useState<boolean>(false);

// Streaming response handling
const reader = response.body.getReader();
// ... process streaming data
```

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Users understand what's happening instead of thinking the app is broken
2. **Reduced Support Requests**: Clear messaging reduces confusion
3. **Educational**: Users learn about cloud infrastructure
4. **Robust**: Handles various error scenarios gracefully
5. **Performance**: Streaming provides real-time feedback

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `WATSON_URL`: Watson ML deployment endpoint
- `API_KEY`: IBM Cloud API key

### Customization
- Retry attempts: Configurable in `tryWatsonInference` function
- Wait times: Adjustable exponential backoff
- Messages: Customizable in `ModelLoadingIndicator` component

## Testing

To test model reloading behavior:
1. Use the app when the Watson model hasn't been used recently
2. The model will need to "warm up" and you'll see the enhanced loading UI
3. Subsequent requests will be faster as the model stays warm

## Future Enhancements

- Model warm-up prediction based on usage patterns
- Caching strategies to reduce cold starts
- Health check endpoint for model status
- Analytics on model loading times
